## How to run the project

1. After cloning the repo, do a `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to install dependencies instead of `npm install`. Why? Because, for now, the library [react-spring/animated](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-spring/animated)
hasn't updated their dependencies to react 19.
Once this is fixed I will update the *package.json*.
2. run `npm start` and your local environment will run in `localhost:5173` or any other port that isn't occupied (vite will automatically tell you what route in the console).
