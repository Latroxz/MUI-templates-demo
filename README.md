## How to run the project

1. After cloning the repo, do a `npm install` to install dependencies, for now the files include a .npmrc to run `--legacy-peer-deps` along with npm install. Why? Because, for now, the library [react-spring/animated](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-spring/animated)
   hasn't updated their dependencies to react 19.
   Once this is fixed I will update the _package.json_.
2. run `npm start` and your local environment will run in `localhost:5173` or any other port that isn't occupied (vite will automatically tell you what route in the console).
